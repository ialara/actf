F-16 Absorption Simulation Model
===================================
This model simulates an F-16 squadron's ability to absorb new pilots.

Development Guide
-----------
Notebooks with ``baseline`` in the title are the best starting point. **The folders are a relic of an abandoned attempt to convert the model from a notebook to a Python project structure**. They are not maintained, nor do I recommend using them.

The other notebooks contain very similar versions of the model, which were run to answer specific scenarios. **The most stable versions will include** ``baseline`` **in the title.**
